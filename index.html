    <article>
        <p style="padding-top: 3rem;"><b>Dear Friend,
        </b></p><br>
        <p>I want to tell you this...
        </p><br>
        <p>I’m on a mission to drastically reduce the rate of death caused by Hypertension. Not just that... I’m on a mission to help men beat Hypertension and start living their ideal and dream life. 
        </p><br>
        <p> So, this is not for you if you want to continually romance Hypertension rather than dealing with it. This is only for those that are tired of Hypertension and ready to wave goodbye forever to Hypertension. 
        </p><br>
        <p> <b>Just imagine, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported  that the number of death worldwide</b>  due to High Blood pressure is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths, about 12.8% of the total of all deaths. Isn’t that scary to you?
        </p><br>
        <p>And to make the matter worse, Africa is leading and remember that Nigeria is an Africa Country.  And that’s excluding thousands others that are not even reported…
        </p><br>
        <p>Imagine those that die from HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE in the village, how will W.H. O know about those people? 
        </p><br>
        <p>But here’s the truth…
        </p><br>
        <p>The reality is that you need to deal with High Blood Pressure right now.  Or don’t you? Of course, you need to. 
        </p><br>
        <p>And that’s why you should pay attention to everything you’ll be reading on this page. I’m a survivor of HIGH Blood Pressure. 
        </p><br>
        <p><b>​I will probably not be sharing this with you if I had died of Hypertension one year ago but here I am, now</b> <span style="color: red;"> totally free of hypertension (I still checked my blood pressure yesterday)</span>.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>What Exactly Made Me Free? And Why Am I Obsessed With Helping People Overcome<br> HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. 
        </b></p><br>
        <p><b>You see, when I was diagnosed with Hypertension, All I was thinking of was getting a lasting solution to my problem.
        </b></p><br>
        <p style="color:red;">The cause of my Hypertension was Genetic; it runs in my family which means it wasn’t my fault.
        </p><br>
        <p>Genetic risk is complex, just as we can’t stop getting old, we can do nothing to avoid it.  I inherited it from my family.  And Hypertension has killed at least 7 people in my family. ( Don’t pity me, it has motivated me to help hundreds of people get their freedom from Hypertension). 
        </p><br>
        <p>Your High Blood Pressure might be caused by any other reason. Yours might be caused by Smoking, Old Age, Lack Of Physical Activities, too much alcohol consumption, Stress, Genetics, being overweight, Too much salt in the diet, Chronic Kidney Disease Adrenal & Thyroid disorders etc 
        </p><br>
        <p>Now, Irrespective of what caused Hypertension for you, you can be totally free. Today, I’m free from Hypertension despite it being caused by genetic mutations.
        </p><br>
        <p>So, if I can be free from Hypertension that was genetic, be rest assured that even if your hypertension is not caused by family history. This will work for you (Even Village People can’t stop it from working for you) . 
        </p><br>

        <p class="i"> Now, you might be wondering what makes this man so confident. 
            <b>Here’s the Answer to Your Question</b>
            
        <p>After I discovered this Indian Herbal drugs recommended by Dr. Akin Owolabi. I’ve recommended it to at least 150 people (they’re more) since the beginning of this year.

        <h1>Hypertension Has The Keys To Alot of Other Deadly Illness…
        </h1><br>

        <p>  Which means once you’re hypertensive (and don’t deal with it), the chance of having Stroke, heart attack, kidney problems is very high. Painfully, all this happens silently until it gets complicated.  This is the reason why Hypertension has been nicknamed “SILENT KILLER”.                                                                                                              
        </p><br>
        <p>For example, your failure to deal with Hypertension might make it turn to Heart Attack.  Here’s what happened…
        </p><br>
        <p> As you know, when your High blood pressure increases, it starts damaging your arteries… The more it damages the artery, the more your artery gets blocked.  And once your artery gets blocked, there will be prevention of the blood flow to the heart muscle. 
        </p><br>
        <p>The resultant effects of all this process is Heart ATTACK because there’s not enough blood flowing to your heart to work effectively. The truth is that it’s better known than experienced… If you’re having chest pain or some irregular Heart beating, you need to take action right now. 
        </p><br>
        <p>And
        </p><br>
        <p>Hypertension also affects your Brain and eventually leads to STROKE.   Just as you already know, when your High blood pressure increases, it starts damaging your arteries including those that supply blood to your brain.  
        </p><br>
        <p>And the Brain should never be deprived from oxygen and nutrients and this is only possible when the brain receives adequate blood supply. So, because of damaged artery and obstruction in blood flow, the brain cells begin to die and it result to STROKE. 
        </p><br>
        <p>You begin to witness weakness in the face, or leg, arm, especially on one side of the body. Stroke Patient begins to find it difficult speaking and even seeing. Again, it’s better known than Experienced…
        </p><br>
        <p>Also…
        </p><br>
        <p>According to a research from Mayoclinic, “High blood pressure is one of the most common causes of kidney failure”. 
        </p><br>
        <p>You already know, high blood pressure causes damage blood vessels. And damaged blood vessels prevent the kidney from effectively filtering waste from your blood, allowing dangerous levels of fluid and waste to accumulate.  And once this happened, your kidney begins to fail. The only solution to this is dialysis or kidney transplantation.
        </p><br>
        <p>Do you know it also affects your eyes?  High Blood Pressure damage the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye (retina), and this can lead to bleeding in the eye, blurred vision and complete loss of vision.  This even gets riskier if you have diabetes in addition to high blood pressure….
        </p><br>

        <p><i>The good news is that. Yes, amidst all this, there’s good news. So, what’s The Good News? 
        </i></p><br>
        <p><i>Here’s it… 
        </i></p><br>

        <p> Research has proven that if you <b>reduce hypertension by 5%, you reduce the risk of other sickness by 34%</b>. 
</p><br>
        <p><b>Isn’t that a Beam of Hope? 
        </b>Of course, it is. A reason you should be dancing right now… Which means all you need to do is to work on normalizing your high Blood pressure. Once you start normalizing your blood pressure, your reduced the risk of getting Erectile dysfunction, Deadly Heart attack , Memory loss, personality changes, KIDNEY FAILURE, STROKE, BLINDNESS  etc 
    </p><br>
        <p>So, can you see you just need to deal with it starting today… 
        </p><br>
        <p>Take my word…	
        </p><br>
        <p>Getting this supplement is one of the best things that will ever happen to you. Even If your Wife is tired of you not being able to give her the style she wants during sex, all this will be solved after taking this supplement.  Hypertension is a “bitch” you should destroy.. Anything that can stop you from enjoying your wife is not worth giving any chance. 
        </p><br>
        <p>And maybe you’re wondering how Hypertension lead to Erectile dysfunction. I’ll tell you. 
            You see, Hypertension decreases blood flow, typically because vessels that supply blood to the penis have narrowed which means the penis won’t be able to stand erection because of decrease in blood flow.</p><br>
        <p>But there’s hope…
        </p><br>
        <p>If Hypertension has already lead to Erectile Dysfunction for you, after you start using  Ajunolive P-14,  she will CUM and still beg for more…
        </p><br>
        <p>Because ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION will be over and you’ll be liberated to go for many rounds as you want it or has she wants it.
        </p><br>
        <p>Not just that…
        </p><br>
        <p>If Hypertension is already causing chest pain, sight problem, strokes, kidney failure silently in your body, then never fear because you just stumbled on the right page. 
        </p><br>
        <p>One of what this Herbal supplement will do for you in the first month is that it will start correcting those side effects caused by those previous drugs you’ve been using. Those Headaches will become a thing of the past, that tiredness will vanish... and you’ll start getting the result you want. 
        </p><br>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">MOST DRUGS HAVE FAILED US
        </h1><br>

        <p>The truth is most drugs have failed us… (Including those recommended by some Doctors). Some of the drugs usually recommended include Beta-Blockers,  Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors, <b>CCBs—dihydropyridines, Alpha-1 blockers, Direct vasodilators, chlorothiazide (Diuril) etc to mention a few.</b>
        </p><br>
        <p>Of course, they sound nice to the ear until you start using them. Their poor and deadly performance in the body is worse than getting F in WAEC. 
        </p><br>
        <p>They promise heaven on earth but when you use those chemical drugs, what they give is HELL.
        </p><br>
        <p>Why? 
        </p><br>
        <p>Some of them leave you with chronic side effects that are even worse than the pain of Hypertension itself. 
        </p><br>
        <p> The most painful thing is that some of those medications cause some mild side effects that you won’t know about until it has damaged your body system. More like, those side effects kill somebody in silence. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Some obvious side effects of some of those drugs includes Depression, Extra urination, Fatigue, foot pain, etc 
        </p><br>
        <p>Some of them increase the pain of asthma in asthmatic patient. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Some of them make you cough for Africa as if you're in a cough competition... 
        </p><br>
        <p>And many more...
        </p><br>
        <p>And I know you might have tried a lot of them and have even given up on using those drugs…
        </p><br>
        <p>I was tired too after I took dozens of them and it never gave any result even though it was recommended by Doctors.
        </p><br>
        <p>The best one I took the last time couldn’t even reverse my Bp from 200/120mmHg. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Anyway, that’s what even makes this Indian Herbal supplement better than most of those drugs out there…
        </p><br>

        <h1 style="color: rgb(95,136,83);"> <b>It’s 100% NATURAL…</b>
        </h1><br>

        <p>No chemicals or any other chronic stuff that can cause side effects…  
        </p><br>
        <p>All you need to do is to follow the dose usage and you'll see the magical effect of this supplement on you.  
        </p><br>
        <p>If you really want your blood pressure to reverse to normal of 120/80mmHg, then your prayer just got answered. Please, read the rest of this page carefully as it’s the last drugs you’ll ever take on Hypertension.

        <p>Introducing</p><br>

            <img src="/asset/logo.png" alt=""><br>

        <p>Let Me Tell You About  Ajunolive P-14
        </p><br>
        <p>Ajunolive P-14 Blood Pressure Formula is a bespoke combination of botanicals and vitamins formulated to support blood pressure levels.  Ajunolive P-14 Blood Pressure Formula can nutritionally support heart health, cardiovascular health, and a healthy lifestyle.
        </p><br>
        <p>Your heart works hard – tirelessly, non-stop. The ingredients in Ajunolive P-14 Blood Pressure Formula work to support this never-ending undertaking, supporting the cardiovascular system as a whole.  Ajunolive P-14 Blood Pressure Formula includes essential vitamins C, B6, B12, niacin and folat.
        </p><br>

        </p><br>
        <p>You see, for our body to survive, our tissues and organs need the oxygenated blood that our circulatory system carries throughout the body. When the heart beats, it creates pressure caused by two forces (Systole & Diastole) that pushes blood through a network of tube-shaped blood vessels, which include arteries, veins and capillaries. Increase in the two forces (Systole & Diastole) is what causes Hypertension. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Because of increase in the forces, the workload of the heart and blood vessels increases which means they’ve to work harder and less efficiently. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Soon, the force and friction of high blood pressure damages the delicate tissues inside the arteries.
        </p><br>
        <p>So, Botanicals and Vitamins in Ajunolive P-14 will support this blood vessel and drastically reduce the blood pressure. 
        </p><br>
